### Spring Boot Admin Library

A modular and customizable admin dashboard library for Spring Boot applications. It provides dynamic filtering, sorting, pagination, file preview, and global search across fields ‚Äî all with minimal configuration.

Ideal for building internal tools, CMS interfaces, data dashboards, or managing entities in CRUD-heavy applications.
‚ú® Features

    üîÅ Dynamic filtering and sorting on any field

    üìÑ File preview support in listings

    üì¶ Pagination with URL state preservation

    üîç Global search across all fields (WIP)

    üîß Easily customizable for different data models

    ‚öôÔ∏è Works out-of-the-box with Spring Data JPA

    üìÅ Enum-based filters for structured querying

üì¶ Installation

Coming soon as a dependency via Maven/Gradle. For now, clone or copy into your project.

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-admin-library.git

üß© Form Field Factory

The FormFieldFactory is a dynamic form generator for Java entity classes. It automatically generates form fields (e.g., TextField, DateField, SearchableSelectField, etc.) based on entity attributes and annotations.

‚úÖ Core Functionality

- Field Type Inference: Determines the appropriate form field component by inspecting:

  - Java type (e.g., String, LocalDate, boolean)

  - JPA annotations (e.g., @Column, @Lob, @ManyToOne, @Enumerated)

  - Custom annotations like @FormInputType and @DisplayField

- Value Extraction:

    Pulls values from the actual entity object (if present) or fallback map.

- Validation Mapping:

        Applies validation rules and error messages from DbObjectSchema.

- Relationship Handling:

        Supports @ManyToOne and @OneToOne by fetching related entities using a shared CrudService.

        Builds option maps using @DisplayField for display labels.

- Support for Enums & Embedded Objects:

        Automatically generates select options for enum types.

        Begins groundwork for handling embedded/complex objects (incomplete but structured for expansion).

üõ†Ô∏è Potential Improvements

- WYSIWYG & Range Field Support:

        Implement support for unhandled FormInputTypes like WYSIWYG and RANGE.

- Embedded Object Handling:

        Currently logs embedded fields but doesn't generate nested forms‚Äîthis could be improved using recursion or child factories.

- Error Handling & Logging:

        Logging is verbose; can be toggled or switched to debug level in production.

        Handle class cast exceptions more gracefully for mismatched types.

- Refactor Monolithic Method:

        Break createFormFieldsFromEntity into smaller strategy-based handlers per type/annotation.

- Custom Field Types:

        Allow user-defined custom components to extend form field rendering.

- Caching for Related Entities:

        Optimize performance by caching related entity lists where necessary.

Annotate Your Entities

    @Entity
    public class Product {
    @Id
    private UUID id;

    @FormInputType(FormInputType.Type.TEXT)
    private String name;

    @FormInputType(FormInputType.Type.NUMBER)
    private Double price;

    @FormInputType(FormInputType.Type.IMAGE)
    private String thumbnail;

    @FormInputType(FormInputType.Type.WYSIWYG)
    private String description;

    // getters & setters...
    }

Custom Field Display with @FormInputType

The annotation @FormInputType allows you to define how a field should be rendered on the admin form:

    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    @Target(ElementType.FIELD)
    public @interface FormInputType {
    Type value();

    enum Type {
        TEXT, NUMBER, COLOR, CHECKBOX, IMAGE, DATE, EMAIL, PASSWORD, FILE,
            TEXTAREA, WYSIWYG, DATETIME, TIME, RANGE, TEL, URL, RADIO
        }
    }

Why it matters

This means you can declaratively control whether a field appears as a textbox, number input, image uploader, WYSIWYG editor, etc., just by annotating the field.

Kraftr AdminX will automatically reflect this in the UI form without extra frontend code.
